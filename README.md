Title: ArrayLinkedList - Linear Single Linked List Implementation of Array in C++

Description:
ArrayLinkedList is a C++ implementation of an array data structure using a linear single linked list. This repository provides a flexible and dynamic array implementation, showcasing the use of a linked list as the underlying data structure for efficient array operations.

Key Features:

Linked List-Based Array: ArrayLinkedList utilizes a linear single linked list to represent an array, allowing for dynamic resizing and efficient memory management.

Dynamic Size: Unlike traditional static arrays, ArrayLinkedList supports dynamic resizing, enabling the array to grow or shrink as elements are added or removed. This ensures efficient memory utilization and flexibility in handling varying array sizes.

Essential Array Operations: The implementation includes fundamental array operations, including element access by index, insertion at a specific index, deletion at a specific index, and dynamic resizing.

Efficient Memory Management: ArrayLinkedList optimizes memory usage by dynamically allocating memory for nodes as elements are added and deallocating memory as elements are removed, resulting in efficient memory utilization.

Error Handling: The implementation incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors, such as index out of bounds or memory allocation failures.

Customizability and Extendability: ArrayLinkedList serves as a foundation for further customization and extension. You can easily modify the implementation or build upon it to incorporate additional functionalities specific to your project requirements.

This ArrayLinkedList repository is a valuable resource for understanding the array data structure and exploring the implementation of arrays using a linked list. Whether you're a student learning data structures or a developer looking to incorporate dynamic arrays into your projects, ArrayLinkedList offers a versatile and efficient solution.

Explore the implementation, leverage the power of a linear single linked list as the underlying structure for arrays, and enhance your understanding of array operations in C++.
